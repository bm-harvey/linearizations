# === RIDGE EXTRACTION ===
# sigma of a gaussian kernel used when calculating derivatives
# larger values might wash out features but smaller values allow for statistical
# fluctuations to dominate more.
# See: https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.meijering
sigma : 2.0
# Every pixel will be assigned a level of "ridgeness" (this is obviously purely intuitive at this level). 
# This threshold acts the limit in which a pixel is considered a member of a ridge.
# Generally a good idea to adjust this parameter by order of magnitude before you adjust it incrementally
# See: https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.meijering
threshold : 5e-4
# number of bins in x and y. More bins will run slower but provide more fidelity, loosely you generaly 
# want more bins and compensate with a larger sigma, but you can weight your x and y values by 
# using different number of bins in each direction 
bins_x : 1024
bins_y : 1024

# === CURVE SELECTION ===

# === LOWESS SMOOTHING ===
# fraction of data to use when fitting local regression. Larger number results in smoother function 
# but too large of a number will fail to accuratly represent local structure
bandwidth: 0.1
# order of poly to fit local regions with. more curvature can be handled theoretically be handled by higher order. 
# In practice 1 seems to be universally decent. This is probably the last parameter to try changing
